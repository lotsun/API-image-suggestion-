# API image suggestion
JavaScript API image suggestion is a feature that uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to suggest images related to a given keyword. The feature works by matching keywords to relevant images from an image library of sources such as Flickr and Google Images.

It then uses machine learning to provide suggestions based on the input keyword. The user can then select the images they would like to use, and the API returns the URLs for those images, ready for use.

In addition to this, the API also has visual recognition capabilities, so it can recognize objects, people and places in images. With this feature, the API can be used to quickly find relevant images for a specific situation or concept.
